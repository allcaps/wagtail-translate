# Wagtail Translate

**Wagtail Translate** adds machine translations to your Wagtail site, with built-in support for [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) and the flexibility to integrate other translation services.
It automatically detects when a page is copied to a new locale and initiates the translation process.

[Wagtail Localize](https://wagtail-localize.org/) and [Wagtail Simple Translation](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/reference/contrib/simple_translation.html) are the go-to solutions for multi-language Wagtail projects.
Wagtail Localize offers advanced features that may be excessive for many projects, while Wagtail Simple Translation only copies pages to new locales, requiring manual translation.

**Wagtail Translate** adds machine translations to Wagtail.
It works in combination with Simple Translation, offering the ideal solution for projects seeking a simple interface with powerful translation support.

## Internationalization

You need to configure your project for authoring content in multiple languages.
See Wagtail documentation on [internationalization](https://docs.wagtail.org/en/stable/advanced_topics/i18n.html).

In summary:

```python
# settings.py
USE_I18N = True
WAGTAIL_I18N_ENABLED = True
USE_L10N = True

LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'
WAGTAIL_CONTENT_LANGUAGES = LANGUAGES = [
    (LANGUAGE_CODE, "English"),
    ('fr', "French"),
]

INSTALLED_APPS += [
    "wagtail.locales",
    "wagtail.contrib.simple_translation",
]

MIDDLEWARE += [
    'django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware',
]

# urls.py
from django.conf.urls.i18n import i18n_patterns

urlpatterns += i18n_patterns(
    path("", include(wagtail_urls)),
)
```

Create the French locale at: `/admin/locales/new/`.


## Installation

```sh
python -m pip install wagtail-translate
```

``` python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    "wagtail_translate",
    "wagtail_translate.default_behaviour",
    ...
]

WAGTAIL_TRANSLATE_TRANSLATOR = "wagtail_translate.translators.rot13.ROT13Translator"
```


In the Wagtail admin interface, go to the homepage, in the dot-dot-dot-menu, choose "Translate".

The contents should be translated! ðŸ¥³

### ROT13Translator

The installation example uses the `ROT13Translator`. It shifts each letter by 13 places.
Applying it twice will return the text to its original form.
ROT13 is good for testing and evaluation, but not for real-world use.

### DeepLTranslator

Wagtail Translation has a [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com) translator.
Install and configure it as follows:

- `pip install deepl`
- Get a DeepL API key from https://www.deepl.com/pro#developer
- Add `WAGTAIL_TRANSLATE_DEEPL_KEY = "..."` to your settings.
- Set `WAGTAIL_TRANSLATE_TRANSLATOR = "wagtail_translate.translators.deepl.DeepLTranslator"`
