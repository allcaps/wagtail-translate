    Wagtail triggers the copy_for_translation_done signal,

    The source_obj must be a subclass of TranslatableMixin.

    Integrators are expected to define their own signal receiver.
    This receiver allows easy customization of behaviors:

    - A custom Translator class can be specified.
    - Pages can be saved as drafts (to be reviewed)
      or published (directly visible to the public).
    - Custom workflows can be triggered.
    - Data can be post-processed.
    - And more ...
